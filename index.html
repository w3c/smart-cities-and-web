<p>
This document is intended to capture the current shared understanding of the W3C Team on the current and expected impact of developments related to Smart Cities services and applications on the Web, and to identify the latest standardization work the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) community has started to handle the issues even better. It does not represent any consensus from the W3C Membership nor is it a standardization document.
</p>
<p>
The document was authored by Kazuyuki Ashimura (ashimura@w3.org), with significant contributions from the rest of the W3C Team.
</p>
<p>
This document aims first and foremost to help structure discussions on what may be needed at the standardization level to achieve the mission of the newly created Web-based Digital Twins for Smart Cities Interest Group. We'd like to gather feedback on GitHub, preferably before @@ @@@@ 2025.
</p>
<p>
Depending on the feedback received, possible next steps include giving feedback to the Web-based Digital Twins Smart Cities Interest Group and getting more in-depth stakeholder interviews.

  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>
"Smart Cities" consists of (too) many stakeholders (vendors, users, governments, …) and technologies (Web, IoT, Software, Hardware, …).
</p>

<p>
So there is strong need:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> To identify and document use cases and requirements that W3C specifications need to meet to support Smart City services and users,</li>
    <li> To obtain feedback from all the stakeholders on the usage of Web technologies for Smart Cities,</li>
    <li>To gather experts’ input on important features for Smart Cities based on Web technology, and</li>
    <li>To provide a forum for technical and business discussions related to Smart Cities.</li>
</ul>

<p>To cope with those issues, we held a dedicated W3C workshop and several follow-up meetings with the key stakeholders from related SDOs, and clarified the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Key stakeholders of Smart Cities standardization to drive the development of Web standards aligned with the real needs of Smart Cities</li>
    <li>Reasonable applications for Smart Cities technologies we agree to build</li>
    <li>How to improve the draft Charter for the potential Smart Cities Interest Group for further discussions</li>
</ul>

<p>Also we identified the following missing points to be covered:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Guidelines for real-world engineering: Device discovery, Inter-system binding, ID authentication and management</li>
    <li>Data transfer and distribution: Governance of data distribution, Semantic interoperability, Catalog for data search</li>
    <li>Some more general issues: e.g., Accessibility, Geolocation</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, W3C have created the Web-based Digital Twins for Smart Cities IG as a dedicated discussion group to handle further discussion around the following based on the collative discussions by all the related SDOs at W3C:</p>
<ul>
    <li>“Digital Twins” as the Key Concept: vertualization of devices, users and services to handle entities from Web applications in a standardized manner</li>
    <li>Standardized Vocabulary for various services: Definition and References based on Ontology standards</li>
</ul>

<p>The main expected deliverables of the group are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Survey on the existing technologies and standards for Smart Cities: e.g., possible building blocks of Digital Twin Framework and standardized Vocabularies for Smart Cities</li>
<li>Best Practices on what kind of technologies to be applied to what kind of Smart Cities applications: e.g., WoT, Automotive, Geospatial, VR/AR, Speech and Semantic Web to be applied to improved accessibility, visitor guidance and energy management</li>
<li>Use cases and requirements for Smart Cities</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we are seeking input from the community on proposals that could help make progress on these topics, and on other topics that this document has failed to identify.</p>

    <section>
    <h3>Why is the Web important to Smart Cities?</h3>

    Some ideas that occur to me:
       - People need interoperability when they travel from place to place
       - People need a reliable interface for people to interact with smart cities, and need accessibility, privacy, etc.

    <section>
        <h3>Why are W3C technologies important for Smart Cities?</h3>

        <p>WoT illustrates the idea of a Web layer on top of various lower level standards.</p>
        <p>Our mission-driven standards will make it easier and safer for people to interact with smart cities. (Talk about horizontal review, etc.)</p>

<h3>Motivation and Background</h3>

<section>
<h4>Initial discussion during the Smart Cities Workshop in 2021</h4>
<p>&quot;Smart Cities&quot; refers to a range of technologies and processes for intelligent management of our built and inhabited environment. As interest rises, we see prospects for smarter and easier integration of various technologies from multiple vendors related to IoT devices and Web services.</p>
<p>Several preliminary use cases on Smart Cities have been discussed within the Web of Thing (WoT) IG as part of the WoT standardization based on the proposal during the Second WoT Workshop in Munich.</p>
<p>However, Smart Cities include various technologies, of which WoT is just one. So W3C organized a virtual online workshop on Smart Cities in June 2021 to finalize this Charter for the Smart Cities Interest Group to collect input from the Smart Cities stakeholders.</p>
<p>During the workshop discussion, we did the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identified Smart Cities standardization stakeholders to drive the development of Web standards aligned with the real needs of Smart Cities</li>
<li>Clarified reasonable applications for Smart Cities technologies</li>
<li>Saw how to improve the draft Charter for the potential Smart Cities Interest Group for further discussions within that IG</li>
<li>We also confirmed that it would be very important to consider inclusive design including accessibility, privacy, security, and internationalization. Smart City applications are tightly related to the people who live in cities. We want Smart City technology to have a positive impact on their lives and want to avoid unintended negative consequences.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Follow-up discussion during the TPAC 2022 breakout, etc.</h4>
<p>Follow-up discussion on Web-based Digital Twins for Smart Cities was organized at (1) the breakout session during TPAC 2022 in Vancouver, Canada and (2) another breakout session during TPAC 2023 in Seville, Spain, and representatives from the following standardization organizations discussed the current situation and problems of their standardization work on Smart Cities:</p>
<ul>
<li>ECHONET</li>
<li>IEC SC3D</li>
<li>IPA (Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan) DADC</li>
<li>ISO/IEC JTC1 WG11</li>
<li>ITU-T SG20</li>
<li>OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium)</li>
<li>W3C</li>
</ul>
<p>As a consequence, the participants identified that &quot;Digital Twins&quot; would be the key concept to handle Smart Cities services in a standardized manner, and got consensus to continue further discussion on a possible framework of Web-based Digital Twins for Smart Cities within the W3C to cope with remaining issues of Smart Cities.</p>
</section>

<h4>What has been done so far</h4>

<section>
<h5>W3C Web of Things</h5>
<p>IoT developers face the big problem of “IoT Silos” when creating an application including multiple services from different IoT platforms.</p>
<p>[Fig:IoT Silos]</p>
<p>The W3C Web of Things (WoT) Working Group has been working on standards to counter the fragmentation of the IoT and enable easy integration of IoT devices and services across IoT platforms and application domains by providing a common description across different ecosystems (=WoT Thing Description), standards.</p>
<p>[Fig:Interconnection of IoT platforms using WoT as a hub]</p>
<p>WoT standards are now being used for various industry areas including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smart home (collaboratively with ECHONET): Improve the usability of home appliances for device users by allowing device users to configure the operation modes of all devices at home without configuring those devices one by one when they leave and come home.</li>
<li>Smart building (collaboratively with IPA DADC): Integrate various sensor networks and various devices by WoT within a smart building which use different data models and protocols.</li>
<li>Smart factory (collaboratively with OPC Foundation's OPC UA (Uivied Architecture): A bottling line consists of a filling module, a capping module, a labeling module, and a transport system. The production line is provided via an OPC UA endpoint for control and monitoring purposes.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h5>Related SDO's work</h5>
<ul>
<li>IEC SC3D's Common Data Dictionary (CDD): Defining common methodology and product ontology for various IoT purposes.</li>
<li>ISO/IEC JTC1 WG11: Various standards on smart cities and digital twins, e.g., ISO/IEC 30146:2019</li>
<li>ITU-T SG20: Standardization on IoT and Smart Cities from the ICT viewpoint, e.g., Data Processing and Management (FG-DPM)</li>
<li>Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC): Geospatial standards and tools around smart cities and digital twins</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>

<section>
<h4>What is still missing?</h4>
<p>During the discussions so far, there are strong needs for the followings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidelines for real-world engineering, e.g., for Device discovery
Inter-system binding including ID authentication and management</li>
<li>Data transfer and distribution including Governance of data distribution, Security and Privacy</li>
<li>Semantic interoperability, Standardized vocabulary, and Catalog to start with the data search</li>
<li>Accessibility, Geolocation, etc.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h4>“Digital Twins” as the Key Concept</h4>
<p>During the discussions at the TPAC 2022 breakout, it was identified “Digital Twins” would be the key concept for Smart Cities services, and we should start with clarifying the use cases and requirements for “Digital Twins” first.</p>
<p>Note that there are various definitions for &quot;Digital Twins&quot; all over the world. However, given the collaborative discussion with ITU-T SG20 and ISO/IEC JTC 1/WG11 starting with the Smart Cities Workshop, we'd like to use the following basic definition from &quot;Y.4605&quot; as the starting point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Basic Definition of &quot;Digital Twins&quot;</code></p>
<p>A digital twin is the digital representation of an object of interest with data connection that enables convergence between the physical state and digital state at an appropriate rate of synchronization. The digital twin has been applied in various industry domains including manufacturing, transportation, energy, firefighting, medical and safety.</p>
<p>- ITU-T Y.4605: Information exchange model for digital twin federation in smart cities and communities, ITU-T SG20 (in liaison with ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 41, JTC1/WG11)</p>
</blockquote>
<center>
<img alt="Fig:Digital Twin Framework" src="https://www.w3.org/2024/06/smart-cities/20240402-digitaltwins.png" width="80%" />
<p><strong>Digital Twin Framework</strong></p>
</center>
<p>Digital Twin framework provides a method to applications to handle physical devices by controlling the digital representations of the physical devices on the digital layer based on the data connection between the digital representations and the physical devices.</p>
<p>A possible data connection mechanism for Web-based Digital Twins, which was agreed on during the TPAC 2022 breakout, consists of the following three W3C standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decentralized Identifiers (DID): define IDs to identify devices and users on the digital layer</li>
<li>Web of Things (WoT): define the capability of physical devices so that they can be handled by applications on the digital layer</li>
<li>Verifiable Credentials (VC): standardized description about user credentials to see what the users can/can't do with the devices on the digital layer</li>
</ul>
<center>
<img alt="Fig:Possible Web-based Data Connection Framework for Digital Twins" src="https://www.w3.org/2024/06/smart-cities/20240402-web-based-data-connectin.png" width="50%"/>
<p><strong>Possible Web-based Data Connection Framework for Digital Twins</strong></p>
</center>
<p>During the group's discussion, we’ll see the other existing definitions of &quot;Digital Twins&quot; from the other SDOs and actual Smart Cities, and work on further clarifications about the definition of “Web-based Digital Twins”.</p>

<h3>W3C Web-based Digital Twins for Smart Cities Interest Group (SCIG)</h3>

<section>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>The mission of the Web-based Digital Twins for Smart Cities Interest Group is:</p>
<ul>
<li>to identify and document use cases and requirements that W3C specifications need to meet to support various services within Smart Cities,</li>
<li>to obtain feedback from all stakeholders on the usage of Web technologies for those services,</li>
<li>to gather expert input on important features for those services based on the Web technology, and</li>
<li>to provide a forum for technical and business discussions related to those services.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Scope of the Group</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><code>[Scope Summary]</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Identification of stakeholders from the industries, countries/cities and communities to involve in the group's discussion</li>
<li>Survey on the existing technologies and standards for Smart Cities, e.g., possible building blocks of Digital Twin Framework and standardized Vocabularies for Smart Cities</li>
<li>Best Practices on what kind of technologies to be applied to what kind of Smart Cities applications, e.g., WoT, Automotive, Geospatial, VR/AR, Speech and Semantic Web to be applied to improved accessibility, visitor guidance and energy management</li>
<li>Use cases and requirements for Smart Cities</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Standards are essential for Smart City technology and business development. Standards benefit vendors, cities, and users. For vendors, standards unify markets and mean that a larger market can be addressed with a single product design, allowing products to more efficiently make returns on the investments needed to develop them. For cities, standards allow the deployment of technologies that can be sourced from multiple vendors, more and higher quality products, and increases the probability that systems will remain usable over a longer timescale. Standards also encourage the development of open systems that can interoperate with other standardized systems, multiplying the number of use cases that can be addressed. For users, standardized technologies mean that services available in one city will also be available in others, facilitating mobility.</p>
<p>However, we need to know what standards should be developed to achieve these objectives. What gaps exist? What opportunities can be exposed by standards that enable new use cases? What are the business drivers that encourage adoption of standards, and how can standard development be aligned with these drivers? Given a set of standards that could be developed, what are the priorities? How can the needs and goals of all stakeholders be aligned?</p>
<p>The purpose of this Interest Group is collect and connect Smart City stakeholders to answer these kinds of questions and drive the development of Web technology standards aligned with the real needs of Smart Cities.</p>
<p>The topics that the Interest Group will address include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disaster countermeasure, including (1) prediction and prevention before disasters, (2) information sharing during/right after the disaster and (3) recovery from the disaster;</li>
<li>Transportation, both public and private;</li>
<li>Logistics, including last-mile delivery of goods and services;</li>
<li>Infrastructure, including IoT-based sensing and actuation;</li>
<li>Energy management and sustainability;</li>
<li>Connection between climate crisis and smart cities;</li>
<li>Relationship with Smart Buildings as part of the geolocation things like location of pipes;</li>
<li>Signage, addressing the problem of timely delivery of information to a diverse population;</li>
<li>Open data portals, including network APIs to data services and the development of app ecosystems;</li>
<li>Data management, facilitating the rapid ingestion, storage, and dissemination of data</li>
<li>Edge and cloud computing, allowing computation to be efficiently applied when and where needed;</li>
<li>Payments, to allow services to be monetized, encouraging new business development and cost recovery;</li>
<li>Privacy, to preserve the rights of citizens and other stakeholders;</li>
<li>Security, to preserve the integrity and safety of systems and protect users;</li>
<li>Accessibility, to incorporate design-for-all thinking throughout all aspects of smart city infrastructure, and ensure accessibility for people with disabilities in every activity and at every stage of life;</li>
<li>Internationalization, to support diverse populations and tourism.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can speculate about many topics, so need to identify what the group's key topics are and see what would fit with W3C through the discussion with the existing smart cities. Note that the topics listed above are related to each other, so the relationship among multiple topics should be described as concrete use cases, e.g., which topics to be considered in what kind of situation.</p>
<p>The main tasks that the Interest Group will undertake include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identification of stakeholders from the industries, countries/cities and communities to involve in the group's discussion</li>
<li>Survey on the existing technologies and standards for Smart Cities (Technology Landscape)</li>
<li>Best Practices on what technologies, e.g., WoT, Automotive, Geospatial, VR/AR, Speech and Semantic Web, to be applied for what kind of Smart Cities applications, e.g., improved accessibility, visitor guidance and energy management.</li>
<li>Smart Cities use cases to which Web technologies are applicable and requirements to provide better support for high priority use cases</li>
<li>The group should also consider the following when work on the above tasks:</li>
</ul>
<p>Identification and prioritization of gaps in Web standards for Smart City use cases;</p>
<ul>
<li>Incubation of technical solutions for the identified requirements by supporting the creation of Community Groups or Business Groups focusing on particular topics;</li>
<li>Suggesting existing Working Groups to include particular topics in their scope as appropriate;</li>
<li>Suggesting the creation of new Working Groups to address particular topics if no existing Working Group is appropriate;</li>
<li>Tracking and review of Smart City-related deliverables developed by other W3C groups, and reporting of issues as appropriate;</li>
<li>Coordination with other organizations to gather knowledge, coordinate input into W3C efforts, and promote development and use of W3C standards within Smart City applications;</li>
<li>Ensuring issues of accessibility, device independence, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security are given equal consideration in all discussions and outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Accessibility is very important for smart cities because cities include many people potentially with disabilities. So we need to look for &quot;missing data&quot; within smart cities, i.e., data of those who might not be well-represented among the data-sets, to ensure that they are surely recognized and well-served by the smart cities. For that purpose, we need to consider people with multiple disabilities (intersectional considerations) and people with cognitive and learning disabilities too.</p>
<p>Note that there are many topics to discuss around Smart Cities and the scope of the group may become too broad. So we'd like to start with discussion about the following two points:</p>
<ol>
<li>what a Web-based Digital Twin framework for for Smart Cities should be like based on the possible Web-based Data Connection Framework for Digital Twins in section 1.6 &quot;Digital Twins” as the Key Concept&quot; above</li>
<li>standardized vocabulary for Smart Cities based on the feedback from the Smart Cities stakeholders including the related SDOs and actual Smart Cities</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal of the group is not to generate standard itself, but to gather pain points, requirements and priorities for Web-based smart cities in the near future. So we need to figure out the focus that W3C can make the most impact. We don't want to duplicate work already done by the other SDOs.</p>
